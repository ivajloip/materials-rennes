\section{Paper Content} % (fold)
\label{sec:Paper Content}
The article that is going to be assessed is \emph{Map-Based Graph Analysis on
MapReduce} by Upa Gupta and Leonidas Fegaras. It provides information about 
data processing using MapReduce framework and more specifically big graph 
processing that requires iterative graph algorithms. The authors of the article
believe that there is a need for efficient design pattern for solving such
problems, as more and more graph data is generated and the size of those
graphs is growing. They propose such a design pattern based on separation of
the immutable graph topology from the graph analysis results.

\subsection{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sub:Introduction}
  The introduction of the article first present the importance of the problem - 
  as more and more companies need to process ever increasing amount of data,
  that is presented in the form of graphs (usually millions of nodes and
  billions of edges), it is often required to use in a way the de-facto
  framework for large-scale data analysis $\rightarrow$ Hadoop.

  The authors also point out, that in most cases the element that has the
  greatest impact on the performance of the algorithms that use Hadoop, is the
  communication time. Although there have been previous attempts to improve
  this aspects of the algorithms (introducing some new design patters for
  example), there is still possibility for improvement.

  The basic idea of the authors is to introduce a new design pattern for a 
  family of iterative graph algorithms. They use an example to describe their
  idea and to illustrate how it can be used in practice. The example is the
  page-ranking algorithm. Although it is described in details how this algorithm
  can be made to use their design pattern, the pattern that they propose can be
  used for many other problem. As expected the improvement has its price and 
  some restrictions for cases where it can be applied. The restriction of the
  proposed design pattern is that it only works for \emph{"iterative graph algorithms
  on directed graphs where partial results associated with nodes can be
  improved at each iteration"}[1]. In other words only data about the notes is
  computed and stored and the algorithm should be trying to optimize it on each
  iteration. There are many situations where such algorithms are needed and as
  a consequence the possible improvement is very important.
  
  Although the proposed algorithm is presented in more details later, a rough
  explanation will be given, in order the reader to attain a better
  understanding of the explanations that are to follow.

  The idea of the algorithm is to divide the graph in several parts (a multiple
  of the number of computational nodes in most cases). Every part is processed
  by a single node that is always the same, i.e. it does not change during the
  different iterations. This way some data that is required for the computations
  (the graph topology that the node should process) can be made local for the
  node and the cost of the communication can be decreased. As the computation of
  each node are dependent on the computations of all the nodes during the previous 
  iteration, all the result from the previous iterations are written on the 
  distributed file system and thus every node can access it for its needs. This
  way the need of reducers is eliminated and as a consequence, it is possible to
  decrease the communication (as shuffling of data is skipped).

  On the overall, the introduction gives good idea about the article.

\subsection{Related work} % (fold)
\label{sub:Related work}
  In this part of the article we are briefly introduced to Twister and Haloop,
  which are attempts to improve the inefficiency of MapReduce framework for 
  graph processing. The two however cannot scale which means that for most 
  contexts they are not usable.

  We are also introduced to Schimmy design pattern[2], but as a disadvantage of
  this technique, the authors of the article point out the fact that it
  "requires the shuffling of the partial results"[1].

  After that it is explained that Incoop[3] and Google's Percolator[4] might be
  good for some purposes, but as they do not target general graph processing, 
  they can not be compared to the proposed design pattern.

  Finally, the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) paradigm is introduced. As "it
  requires that the whole graph be stored in the collective memory of the
  cluster"[1], which greatly limits the size of the graph that is to be analysed
  and so this technique is also not better than the proposed by the article.

  On the overall, the related work section provides a number of examples of 
  other attempts to solve the same or similar problem and for each of them it
  states what is the advantage of the proposed by the article solution.
